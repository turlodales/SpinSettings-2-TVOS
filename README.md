# SpinSettings-2 (TVOS)

Dynamically rotating settings icon for jailbroken iDevices

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello and Welcome This is my own attempted to get it reworking but for 64bit Devices.

for 32bit Devices Plz use the SpinSettings https://github.com/turlodales/SpinSettings
for iPadOS Devices plz use the SpinSettings-2 (iPadSO) https://github.com/turlodales/SpinSettings-2-iPadSO-

my layout is taken form another tweak i have been working so i will be neating this up later just trying to make it looking better and easyer for my own mind.

My own plan is to make it work from see below

- [x] iOS 9 
- [x] iOS 10 
- [ ] iOS 11
- [ ] iOS 12
- [ ] iOS 13

my plain is to make a working verson of SpinSettings for ios 11.0 to 12.0

why am i putting is on github:

for one resaon only extra backup i have the project on my mac mini, my own freenas server, and github so if any one of them gets cruppted i have backup saved.

My own road map
- [x] Step 1 = Get read me finished 
- [x] Step 2 = Start working on the tweak
- [ ] Step 3 = Get it working on My Own Devices
- [ ] Step 4 = Get New Devices or ask for Beta Testers
- [ ] Step 5 = Fix bugs 
- [ ] Step 6 = Relise to the public
- [ ] Step 7 = Update when needed

I would like to say a big thank you to the people that have helped me make this happen:

Josh Doctors the person that makes this tweak in the first place

more to follow if I get help

myself to prove that even someone like me with dyslexia can do something to help the jailbreaking community

FreeNAS OS for my Home Server's

Youtube for the vid's that have helped me do this I will list them all soon more to follow when I have spoken to them if I can post they vids

In case anyone is wondering I started using jailbroken devices from the iPhone original 2G,3GS,4S,5S,6S+,8+ I do like the S models. I only have 2 iPads Air 2 and Pro 12.9. I have the Apple TV 3 and 4 sadly both not jailbroken yet and I have the Apple Watch 1st gen. I now have the iPhone 5C I got of eBay on 10.3.3 and got my iPhone 6 off my mate sadly I don't have any of the SHSH2 blobs saved I just want to help put something back into the community.
